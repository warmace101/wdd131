        <h1>We Stubborn Few Clan Page</h1> <!--Site Name-->
        <p>We represent the stubborn few people that will continuously keep going after an activity until we have completed it.  We don't give up easily and we sure do try to make everyone have a good time.  If you are not having a good time 
            then we will make it so you do by doing something crazy or stupid.

        <!--Site Purpose-->
        <p>The purpose behind this is to make it easier to communicate and schedule activities with members inside of the clan.  Everyone has busy days and what not.  This makes it easier saying this is what you would like to do at 
            this time.

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p>Looking for a Raid group?  No problem, GENNewbold is a raider at heart and will learn with you if he hasn't already done the raid.  Sign up with him and send him a whisper through Steam and see if he has some spare time to help you.</p>
            <p>What weapons should I use?  MrDokMurdok is a weapon expert.  He studies what is good and what isn't.  He will play with you to figure out what your play style is and suggest some weapons that you could use.  He is pretty chill 
                and will help you farm to get some weapons with the perks that would be good for you and your play style.  Shoot him a whisper through Steam and see when he is avaliable.
            </p>
            <p>What is some of the lore that this game talks about?  Tomtomm is our "speaker" for the lore.  He is intelligent about the lore and if he doesn't know about some lore, then he is out there learning it to help spread the knowledge.</p>
